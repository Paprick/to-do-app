# To do app
Everybody Is starting somewhere, but there it is, my first to-do app but with my own little twist.

You can set the tasks for each day in each month and year and navigate using the calendar or navigation buttons. Tasks can be sorted to your liking and deleted whenever necessary.

## Purpose
This app was created to learn and expand my knowledge of react itself as well as libraries used.

## What have I learned:
- expanded my react, js, css knowledge
- about local storage how to save and get items as well as it's advantages and disadvantages
- react dnd-kit and how to make sortable list
- a little bit about ARIA and accesibility
- propTypes
- on how to structure my app
- make everything work dogether
## What I used:
- [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/ "dnd-kit website")
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/ "styled components website")
- [react-calendar](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-calendar/ "calendar website")
- [react-tooltip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tooltip "react tooltip npm")
